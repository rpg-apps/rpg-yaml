# Game procedures
There are two main procedures in the game: character creation and gameplay.

## Character creation
The character creation process is build around choices.
The player first chooses a playbook, then that playbook describes the choices they need to make in order to complete their character.
The choices can be of any type, or from a global or playbook field.

## Gameplay
Guring gameplay, the player has two form of interactions with his character: manual and automatic.

**Manual interactions** - Through manual interactions, the player actively changes values of character fields.
**Automatic interactions** - Through automatic interactions, the player triggers procedures. Even in this mode, the player can disable some of the feature, allowing him to switch them to manual, so the software would just "let him know" instead.
