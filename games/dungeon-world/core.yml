      The poems say an adventurer’s life is all open roads and the glory of coin and combat.
      The tales told in every farmhand-filled inn have to have some ring of truth to them, don’t they?
      The songs to inspire peasantry and royals alike—to soothe the savage beast or drive men to a frenzy—have to come from somewhere.\n
      Enter the bard.
      You, with your smooth tongue and quick wit.
      You teller-of-tales and singer-of-songs.
      It takes a mere minstrel to retell a thing but a true bard to live it.
      Strap on your boots, noble orator. Sharpen that hidden dagger and take up the call.
      Someone’s got to be there, fighting shoulder-to-shoulder with the goons and the thugs and the soon-to-be-heroes.
      Who better than you to write the tale of your own heroism?
      Nobody. Get going.

      The lands of Dungeon World are a gods-forsaken mess.
      They’re lousy with the walking dead, beasts of all sorts, and the vast unnatural spaces between safe and temple-blessed civilizations.
      It is a godless world out there.
      That’s why it needs you. \n
      Bringing the glory of your god to the heathens isn’t just in your nature—it’s your calling.
      It falls to you to proselytize with sword and mace and spell.
      To cleave deep into the witless heart of the wilds and plant the seed of divinity there.
      Some say that it is best to keep god close to your heart. \n
      You know that’s rubbish.
      God lives at the edge of a blade. \n

          You may take on the physical form of any species whose essence you have studied or who lives in your land: you and your possessions meld into a perfect copy of the species’ form. You have any innate abilities and weaknesses of the form: claws, wings, gills, breathing water instead of air. You still use your normal stats but some moves may be harder to trigger—a housecat will find it hard to do battle with an ogre. The GM will also tell you one or more moves associated with your new form. Spend 1 hold to make that move. Once you’re out of hold, you return to your natural form. At any time, you may spend all your hold and revert to your natural form.

          You’ve mastered the care and use of a poison. Choose a poison from the list below; that poison is no longer dangerous for you to use. You also start with three uses of the poison you choose. Whenever you have time to gather materials and a safe place to brew you can make three uses of the poison you choose for free. Note that some poisons are applied, meaning you have to carefully apply it to the target or something they eat or drink. Touch poisons just need to touch the target, they can even be used on the blade of a weapon.
            * Oil of Tagit (applied): The target falls into a light sleep
            * Bloodweed (touch): The target deals -1d4 damage ongoing until cured
            * Goldenroot (applied): The target treats the next creature they see as a trusted ally, until proved otherwise
            * Serpent’s Tears (touch): Anyone dealing damage to the target rolls twice and takes the better result.

      Dungeon World has rules. Not the laws of men or the rule of some petty tyrant.
      Bigger, better rules. You drop something—it falls. You can’t make something out of nothing. The dead stay dead, right?\n
      Oh, the things we tell ourselves to feel better about the long, dark nights.\n
      You’ve spent so very long poring over those tomes of yours.
      The experiments that nearly drove you mad and all the botched summonings that endangered your very soul. For what?
      For power. What else is there?
      Not just the power of King or Country but the power to boil a man’s blood in his veins.
      To call on the thunder of the sky and the churn of the roiling earth. To shrug off the rules the world holds so dear.\n
      Let them cast their sidelong glances. Let them call you “warlock” or “diabolist.” Who among them can hurl fireballs from their eyes?\n
      Yeah. We didn’t think so.
